## About Me

I am a rising senior at the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, WA. In the spring, I will be graduating with a double major in Computer Science and International Political Economy and a minor in Mathematics. My interests predominantly concern the ways that technology and computing can be utilized to create tangible social change.

## About My Mentor

Professor Anat Caspi is the director of the Taskar Center for Accessible Technology at the University of Washington. She is Principal Scientist at the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering and an Affiliate Assistant Professor, Electrical & Computer Engineering. Her research interest include "Ubiquitous Computing and Contextually Aware Automation." You can learn more about Dr. Caspi and her work [here](https://tcat.cs.washington.edu/people/anat-caspi/).

## About My Project

This summer, I will be contributing to the OpenSidewalks Project. My role will be to develop an android app that can integrate with a network of citizen scientists so that we can increase data collection for underreported areas on AccessMaps. The aim of this project is to address the disparities that exist in data about accessibility factors for streets in different neighborhoods. 

At the end of the summer, my report will be posted here: [final report](files/finalreport.pdf)

## Project Updates
I will be posting weekly updates on my progress, challenges, etc. on [this](blog.html) page for the entirety of the DREU.
