title: Week 10 (August 3rd - August 7th)
---

I am at the end of my time for the DREU. I am hopeful that I will get to continue working with this project throughout the fall, I have really enjoyed working with Professor Caspi and the rest of the lab. 

This week I got the app ready to get tested. Delays in finalizing and polishing the app, in addition to COVID 19, have limited our ability to do a comprehensive testing round, though I was able to test the app through some friends that have android devices. By having them go all to the same intersection, I was able to have comparisons of how accurate users were, given the same pedestrian environment. 

I am so thankful for this opportunity and the chance to learn so much this summer.
