title: Week 8 (July 20th - July 24th)
---

This week, I continued with editing and reordering the content with the restrictions of the screens. My mentor found information from the AppInventor people about how others experiencing the 10 screen limit maneuvered around it. One of the ways that folks have done so is by using a vertical scroll layout module to organize content, which I have now incorporated into all of the new content. 

Additionally, I have found it useful to play with the visibility of UI modules after the users have interacted with the module (i.e. having a button disappear after being pressed) to save screen space to include the most content possible. I started with the implementation of the intersection mockup- right now I am having trouble with the part of the back end logic that changes the images to match the buttons that were pushed for the intersection mock-up to confirm the user's selection. 

I think to try and overcome this, I might try a new strategy of having all the images there, but invisible, only to appear when they are the image that was selected. Hopefully, this should work!
