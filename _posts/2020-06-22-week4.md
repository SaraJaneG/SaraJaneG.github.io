title: Week 4 (June 22nd- June 26th)
---

We had our first all lab meeting this week! It was so cool to get to meet everyone that is a part of the lab and hear about the work that everyone was doing. After the all lab meeting, where we also read and discussed an article about Antiblackness in AI, we had a meeting with everyone that is involved in the OpenSidewalks for Equity Collection Efforts project. In this meeting, we were able to talk about how we can develop relationships with schools in areas of interest to incentivize students' data collection and how we could also focus efforts potentially on the bus routes that students use to get to and from school. 

For the rest of the week, I focused on continuing to build more questions and pages on the app and incorporated edits from my most recent meeting with my mentor. Additionally, I worked on getting my DREU site up, running, and feeling a little more like my page!
