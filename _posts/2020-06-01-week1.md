title: Week 1 (June 1st- June 5th)

This week, I mainly worked on getting my project proposal up to speed! After a few initial meetings with my mentor, I have honed in on a project that will increase data collection for the OpenSidewalks project by partnering with a citizen science organization, through the creation of an android app for data collection! In addition to getting my project proposal solidified, I also was able to look at a past student's app that worked on collecting curb ramp data, which I think will be useful as I look to develop a similar app for our topics of interest!
