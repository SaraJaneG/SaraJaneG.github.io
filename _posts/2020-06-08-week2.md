title: Week 2 (June 8th- June 12th)
---

After getting my project proposal outlined, my mentor and I talked about next steps and the motivation behind this project! The app that I'm working on is ultimately going to have to be integrated with SciStarter's interface so that we can utilize their wide base of folks interested in collecting data. This week I am looking into what exactly SciStarter will expect from our backend in order to integrate with their authentication for users. I also started working on the app through App Inventor and started thinking about how to ask the users questions about the intersection features (Accessible Pedestrian Signals, traffic speed/stress, and number of directions of traffic) so that they can provide meaningful information.
