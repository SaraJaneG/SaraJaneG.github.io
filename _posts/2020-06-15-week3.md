title: Week 3 (June 15th- June 19th)
---

This week I mainly worked on familiarizing myself with App Inventor's interface, and learned how to do the backend for the app. I have a few screens of the app developed, and am going to add in some of the screens that a previous member of the lab created. When we met this week, we discussed which of the databases would be most appropriate for the project, and afterwards I rerouted the blocks of the app to utilize a cloud database that should fit our needs a little better! In addition, I am going to add a section on the app for users to add their own stories about the location that they are at, so that we can hopefully gain some more wholistic data about the areas that users will be surveying.
