title: Week 6 (July 6th - July 11th)
---

This week, I'm going to try a new format where I document what I did each day, to see if I can document more of what I'm up to on a day-to-day basis.

Monday: Today I worked on finishing annotating a reading that was sent to everyone working on the OpenSidewalks for Equity Collection Efforts team. After that, and adding my weekly update to this site, I continued my work on the app. Today's app work was mostly spent renaming the modules on a previous member of the team's app, so that it will be easier to incorporate her work into my final app.

Tuesday: Today, I continued the dive into the previous app to try and develop a plan for how I would incorporate previous logic and questions into the app that I'm working on. So far, I have converted one whole page of the previous app onto the new app and am hoping to be done with a few more in the next day or two. This afternoon, we had our all-lab meeting! In the meeting we discussed another article, and it was really cool for me to hear conversations that I would typically hear in my social science major (such as discussions of ethics, epistemology, etc.) based in computer science conversations. After that, the OpenSidewalks for Equity Collection Efforts team had our meeting, where I showed the current state of the app and got feedback from my mentor and others on the team- lots of exciting changes to make!
