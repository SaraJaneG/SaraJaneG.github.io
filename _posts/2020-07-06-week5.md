title: Week 4 (June 22nd- June 26th)
---

This week, I'm going to try a new format where I document what I did each day, to see if I can document more of what I'm up to on a day-to-day basis.

Monday: Today I worked on finishing annotating a reading that was sent to everyone working on the OpenSidewalks for Equity Collection Efforts team. After that, and adding my weekly update to this site, I continued my work on the app. Today's app work was mostly spent renaming the modules on a previous member of the team's app, so that it will be easier to incorporate her work into my final app.
