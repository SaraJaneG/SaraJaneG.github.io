title: Week 7 (July 13th - July 17th)
---

This week was a journey! I was working on the app a bunch, but realized that there is a maximum number of screens that you can make for an app on AppInventor app- ten "screens" per app. This was kind of a hard realization to be confronted with, because I was using screens to organize the different chunks of the app. Therefore, I had to combine a bunch of screens so that I would have room to add more content to the app.

After the lab and project meetings, I was still in the thick of combining the screens to make more space for content. Then, my mentor sent me a few platforms to evaluate for future renditions of this app, that have more space and an easier implementation of UI aspects. These platforms both looked really useful for the work that we are doing, however, I am unsure of how the app will be implemented with various aspects like GPS and other sensors without the interface of AppInventor. 

Overall, this week was mainly spent with the screens work and then continuing with thinking of how to implement the buttons with the intersection mock ups!
