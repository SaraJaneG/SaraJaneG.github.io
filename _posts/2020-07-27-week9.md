title: Week 9 (July 27th - July 31st)
---

Wow, the DREU sure is flying past me- it feels like just yesterday I was learning about and starting this project- and now I have an almost complete and functioning app! 

This week I continued with the image confirmation problem. Essentially, I am running into an issue where I am trying to have users confirm that the inputs they gave for the street corners reflect what they intended by having them show up in that formation on their screen (i.e. if they selected that the top left corner had one curb ramp facing down, that should be reflected in the image that comes up on the screen). I suppose that this isn't entirely necessary- all the database work is already there, but I thought it might be a cool addition. 

Even though in previous pages I've been able to accomplish things like this through just toggling the visibility of, for instance, two out of eight images in a horizontal arrangement, this doesn't seem to be the case on this page. I spent this week trying to fix the logic blocks to try this visibility toggle but, as of Friday of this week, I haven't had success.

Next week, I imagine that I will continue working on this problem and spend some time charting the logic being used to make sure I'm not just missing a block or something small like that.
